# Project Description

## Overview

We decided to create a website that allows users to enter their interests and get suggested travel itineraries. Our approach leverages the ChatGPT API to take the user's interests and construct a travel itinerary for them based on their input. Additionally, we will use a database to store previous user-generated itineraries.

# Product Requirements

## Product Goal

- **Create a web interface for personalized travel itineraries based on a user's preferences.**

## Non-goal

- **Intelligently convert a user's personality into locations, restaurants, and flights they would like.**

## Non-functional Requirements

### Security

- Use OAuth to log into Google.
- Securely store locations and itineraries in a SQL database.

### Usability

- The ChatGPT API will be used to make recommendations personalized to the user.
- Users wonâ€™t have to search to plan their itinerary. The app will provide direct links to book flights and find locations.
