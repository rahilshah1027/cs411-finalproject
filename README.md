# cs411-finalproject

Project Description:
We decided to make a website that allows users to enter their interests and get suggested travel itineraries. We are going to use the Chatgpt API to take the user's interests and construct a travel itinerary for them based on their input. We will use the database to store previous user-generated itineraries.

Product Requirements:

Product Goal: Create a web interface for personalized travel itineraries based on a users preferences
Non-goal: Intelligently convert a users personality into locations, restaurants, and flights they would like
Non-functional requirement: Security
Use OAuth to log into Google
Securely store locations and itineraries in a SQL database 
Non-functional requirement: Usability 
ChatGPT API will be used to make recommendations personalized to the user
Users wonâ€™t have to search to plan their itinerary. The app will provide direct links to book flights and find locations. 

Product Management: 
Theme: Enhancing the travel planning experience using AI and user customization.
